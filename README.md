# DevDrawer

The Android app DevDrawer is originally developed by [Tony Owen](https://github.com/tunitowen/DevDrawer/) but seams abandoned.

It is designed to help developers by automatically adding their apps to a widget for easy launching / uninstalling / reinstalling etc.

Root features such as one click uninstall, and clear cache added by [Ronald Ammann](https://plus.google.com/115926327659831685384/posts).

This project needs a library dependency to [libsuperuser](https://github.com/Chainfire/libsuperuser).
